# Storelight
## Graphql-based storage service for CGAP

The CGAP LIMS has a mature storage feature, wherein barcoded items can be scanned into various freezers, cupboards, benches, shelf spaces, nested in different configurations, in either in an unsorted pile or in grid-based layout.

This application is the beginning of an attempt to decouple that feature from the LIMS so that it can be shared between multiple other applications.

It uses a MySQL database with a simple schema, and has a GraphQL API that supports storing and unstoring items, searching for stored items, creating and examining storage locations in some kind of hierarchy. (The database schema it uses is described in the `storelight-sql` repository.)

Any location can contain other locations, both with and without grid-locations, and any location can store items, both with and without grid-locations. Every location has a barcode (generated by Storelight automatically), and locations can be looked up via a barcode or an id, or by searching the hierarchy. (Clients of the storelight app are expected to impose whatever restrictions are appropriate to their use case on what can be stored where.)

The application is written in Java 11 using Spring Boot.
